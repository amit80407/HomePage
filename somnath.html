                    Kamnath Mahadev Temple is a massive temple complex constructed 200 years ago by King Mayurdhwaj. A huge temple of the main deity, Kamnath, occupies 
                    the center surrounded by many small structures. There are two huge water bodies inside the periphery, a holy pond known as Dudhiyu Talav and 
                    a bathing pool called as 'Mahadev no Kund'. It is widely believed that King Mayurdhwaj recovered from leprosy after bathing in Dudhiyu Talav and 
                    hence many devotees come to take a dip in this pond.
